# Task 1B

In this task, the robot autonomously draws shapes such as **rectangles, squares, and triangles**, based on randomly chosen functions (generate_rectangle(), generate_square(), generate_triangle()). A **Proportional Controller (P-Control)** is used for precise navigation, adjusting the robot's speed based on the error between its current position and the target trajectory.

### **Launch Gazebo Simulation**
```bash
ros2 launch hb_task_1b gazebo.launch.py
